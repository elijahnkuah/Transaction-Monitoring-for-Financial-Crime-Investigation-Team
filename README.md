# Transaction-Monitoring-for-Financial-Crime-Investigation-Team
Project Overview: Fighting Financial Crime with Data
In the fight against financial crime, I developed a synthetic dataset that mimics suspicious transactions flagged by a core banking system. This dataset powers a Power BI report designed to support AML (Anti-Money Laundering) analysts in their investigations.

Dashboard Structure:
Financial Crime Trends & AML Performance

Suspicious Transaction Trends – Tracks flagged transactions over a one-year period, showing daily patterns.
Case Resolution Rates – Displays the percentage of cases closed with risk, closed with no risk, or still in progress.
Alert Categories Breakdown – Analyzes the proportion of fraud, money laundering, and investment scams to identify key risk areas for anti-fraud campaigns.
AML Analyst KPI – Measures analyst performance in reviewing flagged transactions.
Suspicious Customer Investigation

Enables AML analysts to filter and investigate all transactions linked to a suspicious customer.
Displays KYC (Know Your Customer) records for deeper analysis.
